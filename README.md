# HealthSpending
CMS age/gender data
Data are found at: https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/Age-and-Gender.html
Data last updated 5.7.2014

Objective:
Illuminate how healthcare spending varies by age group, gender, and type of service
(Per capita data may be useful because there are different numbers of people within each age group)

Project #1: Filter data by each of the categories, allowing user to explore the data/find themselves in the data
Focus on year: 2010
Elements needed

1. Axes
 
2. Axes Labels

3. 2 bar charts
    A. Per capita health expenditures for each service in 2010 (Dental, Durable Medical Equipment, home health, hospital,nursing care, etc)

    B. Total health expenditures for each service in 2010 
    
4. Filter for age group and gender (to make changes to both charts at once)

5. color scale associated with gender

Possible other additions:
stacked bar chart? Circles representing size of spend?

*Not exactly sure the best way to display this data visually but would like to be able to filter to see multiple combinations and permutations
Ideas welcome
